<TD vAlign=top><i>Work-life balance is a concept including proper prioritizing between
"work" (career and ambition) and "lifestyle" (health, pleasure, leisure,
family and spiritual development/meditation).</i> (Wikipedia)</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD vAlign=top>The importance of mental health and the need for finding the right balance between work and life
is something that is rarely, if ever, talked about, especially in academia. Yet,
many students and faculty alike feel the stresses of modern life and suffer from the pressure
to constantly perform, achieve and produce. According to the American College Health Association, students reported stress, anxiety, sleep trouble and depression as the top four impediments to academic achievement, and 9 of the 10 top factors are mental health and/or coping skills related. </TD>
  </TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=top>Throughout my career and particularly as an undergraduate research mentor,
I have been approached by numerous students reaching out for help in their own individual struggles.
The resulting uplifting conversations inspired me to start offering workshops on work-life balance.
Addressing the different pillars that all contribute to a balanced
life style such as health (sleeping, eating, exercising),
social life (friends, family), and stress-relieving practices (e.g., meditation and yoga),
I provide guidelines that can help students make healthy choices on a day-to-day basis.
In particular the benefits of meditation to body and mind are well established
by medical research and include greater peace of mind, better concentration and
the ability to relax from the stresses of modern life.
During the workshop, participants
experiment with a few short meditations and yoga exercises.
I discuss that while a good work-life balance may seem challenging to achieve 
it is beneficial for all aspects of our life, including and especially for a successful career.
While the content covered is usually not new or surprising to students,
the way the workshop is structured allows students to shed light onto
their own patterns and struggles.
Most important is the creation of a safe space
where those struggles can be expressed and shared with peers,
to help the feeling of community.</TD>
  </TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=top>
A two-hour long workshop by itself is unlikely to produce life changing
and long-lasting results, but it can provide a spark to
bring awareness into this issue as well as the necessary resources
for students and faculty to continue this quest that
will ultimately bring greater happiness into their lives.
The overwhelming positive feedback I have received from the participants
inspires me to continue to offer these kind of workshops to an increasing number of
students. I am convinced that it can help with student success and retention.
I have also started offering a shorter, one-hour long version, focusing on meditation
and mindfulness.

<H2>What we can do as faculty</H2>
If you are reading this as a teacher or professor,
I believe it is important that we, as faculty, acknowledge the challenges that students
are facing in today's world. To support our students better,
we can start by acknowledging that we, too, are struggling with issues such
as stress and finding a healthy work-life balance.
Let's not forget that we are role models to our students.
Here are a couple of concrete suggestions.
For example, we can address explicitely what helps us to stay healthy and nourished.
We can invite our students to come and talk to us about issues that are not solely course-content related,
but more generally concerning their lives that can have a real impact on their academic achievements.
We can include links to campus resources on our class webpage and write a blurb for our syllabus
(e.g., summarizing some of the intro statements made here).
We can try to avoid a midnight or weekend deadline for an assignment, and instead choose
e.g., Friday at 5pm.

<H2>About me</H2>
To balance my work as a teacher and researcher (in astrophysics), I have been practicing various
forms of meditation and body-awareness practices (such as Tai Chi, QiGong, Yoga and conscious dance)
for the past 20 years of my life and have also participated in numerous personal growth workshops.
